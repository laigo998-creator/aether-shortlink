READ ME

For styling, you can put css within the <style> block below. It's not adviced
to edit form action, method, type, and name as well as code inside {} as it could
break adding, deleting, and listing links. Unless ofcourse, you understand what
the code does and you know what you are doing.

It's also unadviced to edit code under /src/routes/api for the same reason.

Other pages you could style are listed in src/routes/alert. The contents can be
modified freely but it's adviced that the main point per page is retained.

<script lang="ts">

// Shortened Links (code)

    import { onMount } from 'svelte'
    import { PUBLIC_SITE_URL } from '$env/static/public'
    let entries = {}

    onMount(() => {
        async function getList() {
            try {
                const response = await fetch('/api/list')
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error('Network response was not ok')
                }
                entries = await response.json()
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Fetch error:', error)
            }
        }

        getList();

    });

// this is the code to show all shortened
// links, you can comment (ctrl + /) the
// entire part to disable it.
